====

Arduino Library that implements Nist SP 800-108 KDF in Counter Mode

##How Installing The Library?

To use this libray, two operations have to be done:
* Download this repository in your [Arduino Libraries Directory](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) e.g. `<arduino installation directory>\libraries`.
* Download the [Cryptosuite Library](https://github.com/Cathedrow/Cryptosuite/) in the same Arduino Library Directory. (NB: The Cryptosuite Library was modified. More datails in next commits.)

##How Testing The Library?

To test the libray, it was used [ArduinoUnit Library](https://github.com/mmurdoch/arduinounit).
So, first of all, it is necessary to download the library inside Arduino Library Directory.
After that, it is possible to execute the test branch contained inside `<arduino installation directory>\libraries\nist\tests` directory.
